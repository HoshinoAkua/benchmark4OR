**Problem Statement: Transportation Problem in energy_distribution**

**Background:**
In the energy distribution sector, electricity generated by power plants needs to be transported to various regions to meet their energy demands. The transportation of electricity incurs costs, and power plants have emission constraints that must be adhered to. The goal is to minimize the total transmission cost while ensuring that the emissions from each power plant do not exceed specified limits.

**Problem Description:**
The problem involves determining the optimal amount of electricity to be transported from each power plant to each region such that the total transmission cost is minimized. This must be done while ensuring that the supply capacities of the power plants are not exceeded, the energy demands of the regions are met, and the emissions from each power plant do not exceed their respective limits.

**parameters:**
Only consider parameters listed below. And these parameters will be provided in a separated "data.json".
{
	'supply': 'The generation capacities of each power plant; list of length (number of power plants)',
	'demand': 'The energy demands of each region; list of length (number of regions)',
	'cost': 'The transmission costs from each power plant to each region; 2D list with shape (number of power plants, number of regions)',
	'emission_rate': 'The emission rate per unit of electricity generated by each power plant; list of length (number of power plants)',
	'emission_limit': 'The maximum allowable emissions for each power plant; list of length (number of power plants)',
}

**Decision Variables:**
The amount of electricity transported from each power plant to each region.

**Objective:**
Minimize the total transmission cost of transporting electricity from power plants to regions.

**Constraints:**
1. The total amount of electricity supplied by each power plant cannot exceed its capacity.
2. The total amount of electricity received by each region must meet its demand.
3. The emissions from each power plant must not exceed the emission limit.

**Implementation Notes:**
The problem should be formulated as a linear programming model. The decision variables, objective function, and constraints should be defined as per the provided parameters. The model should be solved using an appropriate optimization solver.

**Expected Outcome:**
The optimal transportation plan that minimizes the total transmission cost while satisfying all supply, demand, and emission constraints.
