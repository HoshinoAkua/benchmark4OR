In the realm of healthcare, a matter of utmost significance is the effective distribution of resources across diverse departments. These resources, different in their subsequent influence on patient care, must be allocated in such a manner that they don't surpass the existing stock. Now, the challenge posed before us is related to the allocation of varying resources across distinct departments. 

Our ultimate aim is to enhance the aggregate value of patient care provided by all departments and services. However, while doing so, we must keep a firm eye on our stock of resources, ensuring that the allocation leveled across the departments doesn't overrun it. The core aspect to note here is the number of each type of resource dispensed across various departments, as this serves as the central pillar in our endeavor to maximize patient care value while keeping within the resource constraints.

We will only consider the following parameter.
{
    "total_resources_types": "Total number `n` of different resources types",
    "total_departments": "Total number `m` of different departments",
    "healthcare_resource_value": "Value of healthcare resource `i` for patient care",
    "resource_need_per_patient": "Resource `i` amount needed by department `j` per patient",
    "available_resources_per_department": "Total quantity of available resources in department `j`"
}
These parameters will be provided in a separated "data.json" as the above dictionary.
