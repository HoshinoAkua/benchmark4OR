**Problem Statement: Transportation Problem in water_resource_management**

**Background:**
In the domain of water resource management, it is crucial to efficiently allocate water from various reservoirs to agricultural fields. This allocation must be done in a way that minimizes transportation costs while ensuring that the water needs of all fields are met and the capacities of the reservoirs are not exceeded.

**Problem Description:**
The problem involves determining the optimal amount of water to be transported from each reservoir to each field. The goal is to minimize the total transportation cost while satisfying the water requirements of the fields and not exceeding the available water in the reservoirs.

**parameters:**
Only consider parameters listed below. And these parameters will be provided in a separated "data.json".
{
	'reservoirs': 'the available amount of water in each reservoir; list of length (number of reservoirs)',
	'fields': 'the required amount of water for each field; list of length (number of fields)',
	'costs': 'the transportation cost per unit of water from each reservoir to each field; 2D list with shape (number of reservoirs, number of fields)',
}

**Decision Variables:**
- The amount of water transported from reservoir i to field j.

**Objective:**
Minimize the total transportation cost, which is the sum of the transportation costs for all units of water transported from all reservoirs to all fields.

**Constraints:**
1. The total amount of water transported from each reservoir cannot exceed its capacity.
2. The total amount of water received by each field must meet its requirement.

**Implementation Notes:**
The problem should be formulated as a linear programming model and solved using an appropriate optimization solver.

**Expected Outcome:**
The optimal transportation plan that specifies the amount of water to be transported from each reservoir to each field, minimizing the total transportation cost while satisfying all constraints.
