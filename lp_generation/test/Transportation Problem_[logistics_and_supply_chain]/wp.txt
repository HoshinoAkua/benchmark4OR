**Problem Statement: Transportation Problem in logistics_and_supply_chain**

**Background:**
In the logistics and supply chain domain, the transportation problem involves determining the most cost-effective way to transport goods from multiple warehouses to multiple retail stores. Each warehouse has a limited supply of goods, and each retail store has a specific demand that must be met. The goal is to minimize the total transportation cost while satisfying the supply and demand constraints.

**Problem Description:**
The problem involves transporting goods from a set of warehouses to a set of retail stores. Each warehouse has a certain amount of goods available (supply), and each retail store requires a certain amount of goods (demand). The transportation cost between each warehouse and each retail store is known. The objective is to determine the amount of goods to transport from each warehouse to each retail store such that the total transportation cost is minimized, the supply constraints at the warehouses are not exceeded, and the demand constraints at the retail stores are met.

**Parameters:**
Only consider parameters listed below. And these parameters will be provided in a separated "data.json".
{
	'supply': 'the supply available at each warehouse; list of length (number of warehouses)',
	'demand': 'the demand required at each retail store; list of length (number of retail stores)',
	'cost': 'the transportation cost from each warehouse to each retail store; 2D list with shape (number of warehouses, number of retail stores)',
}

**Decision Variables:**
- \( x[i,j] \): the amount of goods transported from warehouse \( i \) to retail store \( j \).

**Objective:**
Minimize the total transportation cost, which is the sum of the transportation costs from each warehouse to each retail store, weighted by the amount of goods transported.

**Constraints:**
1. The total amount of goods transported from each warehouse cannot exceed the supply available at that warehouse.
2. The total amount of goods transported to each retail store must meet the demand required by that retail store.

**Implementation Notes:**
The problem should be formulated as a linear programming model. The decision variables should be continuous, and the objective function should be set to minimize the total transportation cost. The constraints should ensure that the supply at each warehouse is not exceeded and the demand at each retail store is met.

**Expected Outcome:**
The expected outcome is the optimal transportation plan that specifies the amount of goods to be transported from each warehouse to each retail store, resulting in the minimum total transportation cost while satisfying all supply and demand constraints.
