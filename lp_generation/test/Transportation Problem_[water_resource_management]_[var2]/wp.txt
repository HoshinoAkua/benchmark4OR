**Problem Statement: Transportation Problem in water_resource_management**

**Background:**
In the context of water resource management, it is crucial to efficiently allocate water from reservoirs to agricultural fields. This problem becomes more complex when considering evaporation losses during transportation. The amount of water that reaches each field is reduced by a certain percentage based on the distance between the reservoir and the field.

**Problem Description:**
The goal is to determine the optimal amount of water to transport from each reservoir to each field such that the total transportation cost is minimized. The transportation process is subject to evaporation losses, which depend on the distance between the reservoirs and the fields. The solution must ensure that the water requirements of all fields are met while not exceeding the available water in each reservoir.

**parameters:**
Only consider parameters listed below. And these parameters will be provided in a separated "data.json".
{
	'reservoirs': 'the available amount of water in each reservoir; list of length (number of reservoirs)',
	'fields': 'the required amount of water for each field; list of length (number of fields)',
	'costs': 'the transportation cost per unit of water from each reservoir to each field; 2D list with shape (number of reservoirs, number of fields)',
	'evaporation_rates': 'the evaporation rate per unit distance from each reservoir to each field; 2D list with shape (number of reservoirs, number of fields)',
}

**Decision Variables:**
The amount of water transported from each reservoir to each field.

**Objective:**
Minimize the total transportation cost.

**Constraints:**
1. The total amount of water transported from each reservoir cannot exceed its capacity.
2. The total amount of water received by each field must meet its requirement considering evaporation losses.

**Implementation Notes:**
The problem should be modeled as a linear programming problem. The decision variables, objective function, and constraints should be defined according to the provided parameters.

**Expected Outcome:**
The optimal transportation plan that minimizes the total cost while ensuring that all fields receive the required amount of water, considering evaporation losses, and that the reservoirs' capacities are not exceeded.
