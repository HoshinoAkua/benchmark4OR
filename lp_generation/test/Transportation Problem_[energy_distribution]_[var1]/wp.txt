**Problem Statement: Transportation Problem in energy_distribution**

**Background:**
In the energy distribution domain, electricity generated by power plants needs to be transported to various regions to meet their energy demands. This transportation incurs costs and transmission losses, which depend on the distance between the power plants and the regions. The goal is to optimize the transportation plan to minimize the total cost, including both transmission costs and losses.

**Problem Description:**
The problem involves determining the optimal amount of electricity to be transported from each power plant to each region such that the total cost, including transmission costs and losses, is minimized. The transportation must respect the generation capacities of the power plants and meet the energy demands of the regions.

**parameters:**
Only consider parameters listed below. And these parameters will be provided in a separated "data.json".
{
	'supply': 'the generation capacities of each power plant; list of length (number of power plants)',
	'demand': 'the energy demands of each region; list of length (number of regions)',
	'cost': 'the transmission costs from each power plant to each region; 2D list with shape (number of power plants, number of regions)',
	'loss': 'the transmission losses from each power plant to each region; 2D list with shape (number of power plants, number of regions)',
}

**Decision Variables:**
The amount of electricity transported from each power plant to each region.

**Objective:**
Minimize the total transmission cost, which includes both the transmission costs and the transmission losses.

**Constraints:**
1. The total amount of electricity supplied by each power plant cannot exceed its generation capacity.
2. The total amount of electricity received by each region must meet its energy demand.

**Implementation Notes:**
The problem is formulated as a linear programming model and can be solved using optimization software such as Gurobi. The data for the problem will be provided in a JSON file.

**Expected Outcome:**
The optimal transportation plan that specifies the amount of electricity to be transported from each power plant to each region, minimizing the total cost while satisfying all constraints.
