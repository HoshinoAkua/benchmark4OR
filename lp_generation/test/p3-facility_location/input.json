    "description": "A large retail corporation seeks to expand its operations to new locations in order to reach and serve more of its customer base. After careful research, they have pinpointed possible commercial properties that could serve as new retail sites. They have also gathered critical information on local demographics to help refine their business decisions. \n\nThe corporation needs to decide for each potential site, whether or not to establish a new store at that location, and for each customer zone, which store or stores will serve that area. These choices should aim to limit the corporation\u2019s total costs. These costs include both the expenses associated with opening new stores and the cost of delivering services to different customer zones.\n\nHowever, the corporation needs to adhere to several considerations while making these choices. First, each customer zone must have at least one retail store servicing it. Second, every store has a maximum limit on how many customer zones it can provide services for, which cannot be exceeded. Third, a store must actually be established at a potential site before it can serve any customer zone. Lastly, the corporation's choices on store establishment and customer zone servicing are absolute and do not cater for intermediate options. \n\nEach potential site will be either selected for opening a store or not, and each customer zone will be serviced by a selected store or not, leaving no room for partial choices. The corporation therefore needs to make these decisions in a manner that best balances costs, customer zone servicing and store capacity.\n\n\nWe will only consider the following parameter.\n{\n    \"sites\": \"Potential commercial properties for use\",\n    \"vicinities\": \"Vicinities with demographic information\",\n    \"openStoreCosts\": \"Costs to open new stores at each site\",\n    \"serviceCosts\": \"Costs to serve each customer zone\",\n    \"siteCapacity\": \"Maximum capacity of each potential site\",\n    \"demandPerZone\": \"Measure of required service per customer zone\"\n}\nThese parameters will be provided in a separated \"data.json\" as the above dictionary. \n"
