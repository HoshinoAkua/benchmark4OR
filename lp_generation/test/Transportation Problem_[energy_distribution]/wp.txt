**Problem Statement: Transportation Problem in energy_distribution**

**Background:**
In the energy distribution sector, it is crucial to efficiently allocate electricity generated by power plants to various regions that require energy. The goal is to minimize the total transmission cost while ensuring that the supply from each power plant does not exceed its capacity and the demand of each region is met.

**Problem Description:**
The problem involves determining the optimal amount of electricity to be transported from each power plant to each region. The objective is to minimize the total transmission cost, given the generation capacities of the power plants and the energy demands of the regions.

**parameters:**
Only consider parameters listed below. And these parameters will be provided in a separated "data.json".
{
	'supply': 'The generation capacities of each power plant; list of length (number of power plants)',
	'demand': 'The energy demands of each region; list of length (number of regions)',
	'cost': 'The transmission costs from each power plant to each region; 2D list with shape (number of power plants, number of regions)',
}

**Decision Variables:**
The amount of electricity transported from each power plant to each region.

**Objective:**
Minimize the total transmission cost of transporting electricity from power plants to regions.

**Constraints:**
1. The total amount of electricity supplied by each power plant cannot exceed its capacity.
2. The total amount of electricity received by each region must meet its demand.

**Implementation Notes:**
The problem should be formulated as a linear programming model. The decision variables represent the amount of electricity transported from each power plant to each region. The objective function is to minimize the total transmission cost. The constraints ensure that the supply from each power plant does not exceed its capacity and the demand of each region is satisfied.

**Expected Outcome:**
The optimal transportation plan that minimizes the total transmission cost while meeting the supply and demand constraints.
