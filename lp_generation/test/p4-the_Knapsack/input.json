    "description": "The challenge at hand involves the field of finance and specifically pertains to the selection of an optimal portfolio from various assets. These assets differ from each other in their costs and returns. The complication arises due to a limited budget available for investment, which restricts how many and which assets can be purchased. This scenario is akin to trying to fill a knapsack, which has a defined capacity, with items, each with its individual weight and value. The aim is to maximize the total value derived from the items chosen, without the total weight exceeding the capacity of the knapsack.\n\nEach asset in this situation has two potential states; either it's chosen for investment, which we'll represent as 1, or it's not selected, denoted by 0. This decision of whether or not to invest in each asset is what we will call our variables.\n\nThe primary goal here is to maximize the total return from the portfolio. In other words, we are seeking an investment strategy wherein we decide for each asset (our variables) such that our total returns, which are the sum of each asset's potential return times its chosen state, maximized.\n\nHowever, as noted above, we have to work within our budget. Our total investment across selected assets cannot surpass our available funds. This represents our first constraint. Moreover, our second constraint is straightforward - for each asset we can either invest in it or not. It's a binary decision. \n\nThat's the challenge - maximize your returns by selecting investments wisely within the constraints of a limited budget and binary decisions. Good luck!\n\nWe will only consider the following parameter.\n{\n    \"total_assets\": \"Total number of available assets\",\n    \"investment_budget\": \"Budget allocated for the investment\",\n    \"asset_returns\": \"Returns associated with each asset\",\n    \"asset_costs\": \"Costs associated with each asset\"\n}\nThese parameters will be provided in a separated \"data.json\" as the above dictionary. \n"
