**Problem Statement: Transportation Problem in water_resource_management**

**Background:**
In water resource management, it is crucial to efficiently distribute water from reservoirs to agricultural fields. This problem becomes more complex when considering evaporation losses during transportation. The amount of water that reaches each field is reduced by a certain percentage based on the distance between the reservoir and the field.

**Problem Description:**
The goal is to determine the optimal amount of water to transport from each reservoir to each field to minimize the total transportation cost while ensuring that each field receives the required amount of water after accounting for evaporation losses. The transportation cost and evaporation rates vary based on the distance between the reservoirs and the fields.

**parameters:**
Only consider parameters listed below. And these parameters will be provided in a separated "data.json".
{
	'reservoirs': 'available amount of water in each reservoir; list of length (number of reservoirs)',
	'fields': 'required amount of water for each field; list of length (number of fields)',
	'costs': 'transportation cost per unit of water from each reservoir to each field; 2D list with shape (number of reservoirs, number of fields)',
	'evaporation_rates': 'evaporation rate per unit distance from each reservoir to each field; 2D list with shape (number of reservoirs, number of fields)',
}

**Decision Variables:**
The amount of water transported from each reservoir to each field.

**Objective:**
Minimize the total transportation cost.

**Constraints:**
1. The total amount of water transported from each reservoir cannot exceed its capacity.
2. The total amount of water received by each field must meet its requirement, considering evaporation losses.

**Implementation Notes:**
The problem should be formulated as a linear programming model. The decision variables represent the amount of water transported from each reservoir to each field. The objective is to minimize the total transportation cost, and the constraints ensure that the water transported does not exceed the reservoir capacities and meets the field requirements after accounting for evaporation losses.

**Expected Outcome:**
The optimal transportation plan that minimizes the total cost while ensuring that each field receives the required amount of water after evaporation losses.
